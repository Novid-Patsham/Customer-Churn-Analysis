# Customer-Churn-Analysis

The project analyzes personal and transactional data from a bank's customers recorded over a year utilizing tools such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and statistical modules to uncover insights into customer behavior and potential churn rate. The dataset includes features like customer demographics, transaction details, and banking history. 

The project employs data preprocessing and various analysis techniques such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis along with hypopthesis testing aiming to unveil patterns and predictors related to customer churn. The insights derived from this analysis assist in identifying potential churn factors, contributing to strategic decision-making for effective customer retention.
